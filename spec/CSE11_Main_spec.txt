MyLocalHub: Revitalising the Local Economy Through a Community-
Driven Mobile App
Over the past decade, the City Council of Larnaka has been facing a growing concern shared
by many European cities: the gradual decline of small, independent businesses in the face of
aggressive competition from large retail chains and the rapid rise of e-commerce platforms.
Once-vibrant neighbourhoods filled with family-owned bakeries, artisan cafés, handmade
crafts, traditional shops, and local service providers have slowly witnessed decreasing foot
traffic. The impact has been felt not only economically but also socially, as local commerce
has traditionally played a crucial role in shaping neighbourhood identity, strengthening
community ties, and supporting the city’s cultural character.
Local shop owners report a consistent pattern: customers rarely discover their stores unless
they happen to walk past them. Printed flyers and posters have limited reach, word-of-mouth
marketing has weakened, and most businesses lack the digital skills or budget needed to
maintain an online presence. The situation worsened during the pandemic years, after which
many small businesses never regained their usual customer volume. A recent survey conducted
by the City Council revealed that 62% of residents were unaware of the variety of local shops
available in their own neighbourhood, and 57% stated that they would support local businesses
more if there were convenient digital loyalty programmes instead of paper-based stamp cards
that are often lost or forgotten.
Recognising these challenges, the City Council has partnered with the Local Business
Association to launch MyLocalHub, an ambitious initiative designed to modernise the
relationship between citizens and the small businesses in their city. MyLocalHub is envisioned
as a mobile application that would act as a centralised digital platform through which residents,
visitors, and business owners can interact more meaningfully. The Council aims for the app to
become the primary gateway for discovering neighbourhood shops, receiving personalised
offers, attending local events, and collecting digital rewards that incentivise community
engagement.
At the heart of MyLocalHub is the belief that local commerce is more than economic activity—
it's part of the social fabric of the city. The Council hopes that by improving digital visibility
and offering innovative engagement tools, residents will rediscover the value of supporting

their local community. The app is intended to run on recent operating systems (Android 15 and
iOS 17) and will incorporate modern UX principles to ensure that even users who are not
technologically confident can navigate it easily.
The application is expected to provide a smooth and engaging experience from the moment
users open it. Citizens should be able to browse shops based on categories such as food and
drink, crafts, beauty, professional services, and leisure. Each business will have its own profile,
featuring photos, opening hours, specialities, and customer reviews. Importantly, the Council
wants the app to feel warm, personal, and community-focused, rather than corporate or
transactional.
Functionality of the New Mobile App:
The application is expected to provide a smooth and engaging experience from the moment
users open it.
▪ Citizens should be able to browse shops based on categories such as food and drink,
crafts, beauty, professional services, and leisure.
▪ Each business will have its own profile, featuring photos, opening hours, specialities,
and customer reviews. Importantly, the Council wants the app to feel warm, personal,
and community-focused, rather than corporate or transactional.
▪ A key feature of MyLocalHub is its digital loyalty and rewards system. Most small
businesses currently rely on physical stamp cards, which are frequently misplaced or
forgotten. The new digital version will allow users to collect points automatically with
every purchase and redeem them for rewards, such as free items, exclusive discounts,
or early access to offers. Business owners strongly support this direction, as they believe
it will help build customer loyalty and encourage repeated visits.
▪ The Council also wants to integrate elements of persuasive design, such as
achievement badges for supporting local businesses, weekly streaks for visiting certain
neighbourhoods, and gentle reminders about upcoming events or expiring rewards.
▪ Another important aspect is the inclusion of a community events calendar, which
many residents have requested. Currently, local events such as farmers’ markets,
cultural performances, craft workshops, and pop-up exhibitions are announced
informally through social media or posters on lamp posts. MyLocalHub will bring these
events together into a single, easily accessible digital space, increasing participation
and helping event organisers reach broader audiences.
3
Dr Avgousta Kyriakidou Zacharoudiou
▪ While the initial release focuses on customers accessing local shops, exploring offers,
joining events, and claiming rewards, the long-term vision includes creating a business
dashboard for shop owners.
▪ This dashboard will eventually allow businesses to upload their own offers, track
customer engagement, and access insights about foot traffic and loyalty patterns.
Although this dashboard is outside the scope of the student prototype, it shapes several
of the user needs and requirements for the customer-facing mobile experience.
The development of MyLocalHub is being spearheaded by Marketing Director Anna
Papadopoulou, who emphasises that the project must not only be functional but also
emotionally resonant. She wants the digital experience to evoke a sense of belonging, pride,
and community support. The Council sees MyLocalHub as more than a utility; it should feel
like a friendly companion that encourages people to explore their city, discover hidden gems,
and support local businesses in a meaningful way.
Your design team has already secured the contract to create the app’s initial user interface
design. You are now expected to produce a high-fidelity prototype that demonstrates how
residents will navigate the app, access business information, collect rewards, explore events,
and engage with their community. The prototype must be aesthetically coherent and
incorporate elements of persuasive design and emotional interaction, as the Council places
strong emphasis on creating an experience that is both helpful and inspiring.
Task Overview:
Design a high-fidelity prototype of the proposed mobile application’s user interface for
MyLocalHub. The design should consider user requirements across multiple screens, ensuring
clear navigation between them. The prototype should effectively conceptualize and visualise
the software, serving as a proof of concept for the final product.
Requirements:
• Apply UX/UI design theory.
• Include navigation flow between screens.
• Conduct an evaluation using an appropriate technique to assess usability and
functionality.

evaluation criteria.
ii. AI Evaluation: Perform a second evaluation of your prototype, using one AI tool of
your choice and include the results in the report.

and how AI can refine the design.
Deliverable 2: Individual component
Reflection and evaluation report (500+ words) providing:
Critical Reflection:

the design process. Discuss group dynamics and challenges faced. Finally reflect on how you
will apply what you’ve learnt in future UX/UI projects.
Deliverable 1 and 2 need to be included in the same report and submitted as
ONE pdf file.
