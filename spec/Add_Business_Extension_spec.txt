Feature Extension Specification: Add Business (MyLocalHub)

1. Overview
The "Add Business" feature is designed to empower local entrepreneurs to join the MyLocalHub community. By providing a simple, warm, and encouraging interface, we lower the barrier for traditional business owners (like Georgios) to establish a digital presence.

2. Visual Design & User Interface
The design follows the established "MyLocalHub" visual strategy, emphasizing warmth and trust. The feature is primarily accessible via the Profile section to keep the main Explore page focused on discovery for regular users.
